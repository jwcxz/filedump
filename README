INTRODUCTION
	This is a very simple utility to upload, delete, and list files in a single directory.

INSTALLATION
	1) Upload index.php to a directory on your server.
	2) Using your favorite editor, edit the first few lines for the configuration.

USAGE
	example situation: you have an installation on http://example.org/fd/

	LISTING FILES
		Go to http://example.org/fd/ to see a list of all files in this directory (minus the 
		ones you chose to ignore in the configuration).  Type a few characters into the input
		box to filter the results.

		Alternatively, you can go to http://example.org/fd/?term to immediately filter by a
		search term.  This can be helpful if you have a bunch of photos from a specific set
		(e.g. laser1.jpg, laser2.jpg, etc.).

	MANAGING FILES
		If you place your cursor at the far top right of the page, you'll notice an "adm"
		link.  Click it and type in your password.  You will now be presented with the
		administration screen.

		You can upload a file by using the first field.  You can also manually create a text
		file by typing a filename into the second field (a text box will appear for the file
		content.

		To delete a file, click the "del" link (once to arm, again to confirm).
